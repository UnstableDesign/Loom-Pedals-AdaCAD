# Loom Pedals: AdaCAD
 
 The loom pedals are a hardware peripheral interface for the TC2 digital Jacquard loom by Tronrud Engineering. They have been designed as a modular system of foot pedals, similar to guitar effects pedals used by musicians, which are connected via a Raspberry Pi to a web-based open source weaving software, [AdaCAD](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/AdaCAD). 
 
 This repository contains the TypeScript files added to the main AdaCAD codebase, which can be used to manually install the loom pedals extension in AdaCAD. AdaCAD is built with the Angular framework, so the repo is separated by Angular services and components.
